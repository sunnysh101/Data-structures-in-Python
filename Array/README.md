# Array in Python

An array is:
- A collection of elements of the same data type
- Stored in contiguous memory locations
- Accessed using an index that represents the position of an element in the array
- The first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on
- To work with arrays in Python:

Use the built-in array module
- Create an array using the array() function
- Specify the data type of the elements in the array and the initial values of the elements
-Manipulate the elements in the array using various array methods, such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), and pop()

Arrays are useful for:
- Storing and manipulating large amounts of data
- Memory-efficient ways
- Applications such as scientific computing, numerical analysis, and data processing.
